        "In this tutorial, you will create a LangChain agentic RAG system using the IBM [Granite-3.0-8B-Instruct model](https://www.ibm.com/granite) now available on [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) that can answer complex queries about the 2024 US Open using external information.\n",

        "## What is RAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "[RAG](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG) is a technique in [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/natural-language-processing) that combines information retrieval and generative models to produce more accurate, relevant and contextually aware responses. In traditional language generation tasks, [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/large-language-models) such as Meta's [Llama Models](https://llama.meta.com/) or IBM’s [Granite Models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) are used to construct responses based on an input prompt. Common real-world use cases of these large language models are chatbots. When models are missing relevant information that is up to date in their knowledge base, RAG is a powerful tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What are AI agents?\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core of agentic RAG systems are [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) agents. An [AI agent](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-agents) refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and using available tools. Agentic technology implements tool use on the backend to obtain up-to-date information from various data sources, optimize workflow and create subtasks autonomously to solve complex tasks. These external tools can include external data sets, search engines, APIs and even other agents. Step-by-step, the agent reassesses its plan of action in real time and self-corrects.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## Agentic RAG versus traditional RAG\n",
        "\n",
        "Agentic RAG frameworks are powerful as they can encompass more than just one tool. In traditional RAG applications, the LLM is provided with a vector database to reference when forming its responses. In contrast, agentic RAG implementations are not restricted to document agents that only perform data retrieval. RAG agents can also have tools for tasks such as solving mathematical calculations, writing emails, performing data analysis and more. These tools can be supplemental to the agent's decision-making process. AI agents are context-aware in their multistep reasoning and can determine when to use appropriate tools.\n",
        "\n",
        "AI agents, or intelligent agents, can also work collaboratively in [multiagent systems](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/multiagent-system), which tend to outperform singular agents. This scalability and adaptability is what sets apart agentic RAG agents from traditional RAG pipelines.\n",

        "# Prerequisites\n",
        "\n",
        "You need an [IBM Cloud® account](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) to create a [watsonx.ai™](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) project.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "**Please check out this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sav6vUG_XQ) that walks you through the following set up instructions in Steps 1 and 2.**\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 1. Set up your environment\n",
        "\n",
        "While you can choose from several tools, this tutorial walks you through how to set up an IBM account to use a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Log in to [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/registration/stepone?context=wx&apps=all) using your IBM Cloud account.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a [watsonx.ai project](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=projects-creating-project).\n",
        "\n",
        "\tYou can get your project ID from within your project. Click the **Manage** tab. Then, copy the project ID from the **Details** section of the **General** page. You need this ID for this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Create a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=editor-creating-managing-notebooks).\n",
        "\n",
        "This step will open a Notebook environment where you can copy the code from this tutorial.  Alternatively, you can download this notebook to your local system and upload it to your watsonx.ai project as an asset.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 2. Set up a Watson Machine Learning (WML) service instance and API key.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create a [Watson Machine Learning](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-machine-learning) service instance (select your appropriate region and choose the Lite plan, which is a free instance).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Generate an [API Key in WML](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-authentication.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Associate the WML service to the project that you created in [watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/assoc-services.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Step 3. Install and import relevant libraries and set up your credentials\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll need a few libraries and modules for this tutorial. Make sure to import the following ones; if they're not installed, you can resolve this with a quick pip installation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Python frameworks for building agentic RAG systems include LangChain and LlamaIndex. In this tutorial, we will be using LangChain.  \n"

And to keep them coming back for more, the United States Tennis Association (USTA) has worked side-by-side with IBM Consulting® for more than three decades, developing and delivering a world-class digital experience that constantly advances its features and functionality.\\n\\n“The digital experience of the US Open is of enormous importance to our global fans, and therefore to us,” says Kirsten Corio, Chief Commercial Officer at the USTA. “That means we need to constantly innovate to meet the modern demands of tennis fans, anticipating their needs, but also surprising them with new and unexpected experiences.”\\nTo help the US Open stay on the cutting edge of customer experience, IBM Consulting worked closely with the USTA to develop generative AI models that transform tennis data into insights and original content on the US Open app and website. To do this, the USTA used IBM® watsonx™, an AI and data platform built for business, and powerful AI models, including IBM Granite™ foundation models, to help develop key app features, such as Match Reports and AI Commentary for US Open highlight reels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      15M\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWorld-class digital experiences for more than 15 million fans around the globe\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      7M\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIBM captures and analyzes more than 7 million data points throughout the tournament\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            \\n                \\n                     \\n                        \\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      The AI models built with watsonx do more than enhance the digital experience of the US Open. They also scale the productivity of our editorial team by automating key workflows.\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n                        \\n                \\n            \\n        \\n        \\n            Kirsten Corio\\n        \\n\\n            Chief Commercial Officer\\n        \\n\\n            United States Tennis Association\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Generative AI experiences, built with watsonx\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe US Open is a sprawling, two-week tournament, with hundreds of matches played on 22 different courts. Keeping up with all the action is a challenge, both for tennis fans and the USTA editorial team covering the event. So, the USTA asked IBM to design, develop, and deliver solutions that enhance the digital experience and help its team serve up more content, covering more matches throughout the tournament.\\nTo do it, the IBM Consulting team built generative AI-powered features using the watsonx AI and data platform. For example, Match Reports are AI-generated post-match summaries that are designed to get fans quickly up to speed on the action from around the tournament. AI Commentary adds AI-generated, spoken commentary to match highlights. And SlamTracker–the premier scoring application for the US Open–features AI-generated match previews and recaps.\\n“The AI models built with watsonx do more than enhance the digital experience of the US Open,” says Kirsten Corio, Chief Commercial Officer, USTA. “They also scale the productivity of our editorial team by automating key workflows.”\\nThe IBM team worked with multiple AI models to develop the new features, including the family of Granit AI models. These large language models already understand language, but they needed to be trained, or “tuned,” on tennis data in order to translate US Open action into sentences and summaries.\\n“Foundation models are incredibly powerful and are ushering in a new age of generative AI,” says Shannon Miller, a Partner at IBM Consulting. “But to generate meaningful business outcomes, they need to be trained on high-quality data and develop domain expertise. And that’s why an organization’s proprietary data is the key differentiator when it comes to AI.”\\nThe team used watsonx.data to connect and curate the USTA’s trusted data sources. The curation process includes de-duping and filtering the foundational data that informs the large language model, as well as the USTA’s proprietary data. The process filters for things like profanity or abusive language and objectionable content.\\nThe models were then trained to translate tennis data into cogent descriptions, summarizing entire matches in the case of Match Reports, or generating sentences that describe the action in highlight reels for AI Commentary. Over the course of the 2024 US Open, Match Reports and AI Commentary will be generated for all men’s and women’s singles matches; something the USTA editorial team has never done before. And the ongoing operation of the models is monitored and managed using elements of watsonx.governance, which ensures the AI is performant, compliant and operating as expected.\\nDuring the software development phase of the project, the team took advantage of a powerful generative AI assistant to increase the efficiency and accuracy of its code. IBM watsonx Code Assistant™ uses generative AI from a purpose-built Granite model to accelerate software development, helping developers generate code based on natural language prompts. The team used this tool to analyze and explain snippets of code, annotate code to facilitate better collaboration between developers, and auto-complete snippets of analyzed code.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n                \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Platform of innovation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo develop new capabilities every year, the USTA needs to move with speed and purpose. The process starts the week after the US Open concludes, when IBM Consulting kicks off work using the IBM Garage™ Methodology, a highly collaborative approach to co-creation.\\n“When we engage with a client, it’s critical that we work closely together every step of the way, ideating, iterating and adapting as we drive toward the client’s desired end state,” says Miller.\\nIn order to transform new ideas into digital reality, IBM Consulting designs, develops, and manages a powerful digital infrastructure capable of processing structured and unstructured data, and integrating technology from a variety of sources. This foundational infrastructure is advanced and improved upon every year.\\n“It used to be that innovation cycles were measured in years,” says the USTA’s Corio. “But now, innovation is measured in weeks and days, and it can come from anywhere. So, we needed a flexible platform that could handle all kinds of data, automate the process of turning data into insight, and do it all while protecting the entire digital environment.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            \\n                \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    From data to insight\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe raw material of any digital experience is data, and the US Open tournament produces a lot of it. For starters, each US Open consists of 128 men and 128 women singles players, and a total of seven rounds for each tournament. Each tennis player comes with his or her own data set, including world ranking and recent performance. But that’s just the beginning.\\nOver the course of the tournament, more than 125,000 points will be played. And each one of those points generates its own data set: serve direction, speed, return shot type, winner shot type, rally count and even ball position. All told, more than seven million data points are generated during the tournament.\\nTo add more texture and context to the US Open digital experience, the team wanted to go beyond the numbers. So, they used AI to analyze the language and sentiment of millions of articles from hundreds of thousands of different sources to develop insights that are unique and informative, for instance, the likelihood to Win predictions for all singles matches. To help manage the collection, integration, and analysis of the data sets, IBM used IBM watsonx.data™, a purpose-built data store specifically designed to handle AI workloads.\\n“It’s a massive data management operation, incorporating multiple sources of data and a variety of partners,” says Miller. “But the magic happens when you combine hard data like stats and scores with unstructured data like media commentary. That is what gives tennis fans a more complete picture of each match.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n    Automation, containerization and other efficiencies\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n            \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTo streamline this process, during the years working with the UTSA, IBM Consulting built automated workflows that integrate and orchestrate the flow of data through the various applications and AI models needed to produce the digital experience. These workflows are made possible by a hybrid cloud architecture and the containerized apps running on Red Hat®\\xa0OpenShift®\\xa0on IBM Cloud.\\xa0The US Open hybrid multicloud architecture is made up of four public clouds, drawing on data from a variety of sources and integrating features and capability from a variety of partners. By containerizing the applications, the team can write them once and run them anywhere, ensuring that the right data gets to the right application on the right cloud.\\n\\n“With this platform, we’re capable of doing things that were not possible just a few years ago,” says Corio. “Managing all that data, producing AI-generated insights, securing the environment … IBM just makes it all come together for us. And I can’t wait to see what the future of the partnership holds.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n            \\n                \\n                     \\n                        \\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n      Managing all that data, producing AI-generated insights, securing the environment…IBM just makes it all come together for us.

Both will be available on the USTA’s USOpen.org website.\\nOpen Questions with Watson will employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities in IBM\\'s Watson\\xa0 Discovery, IBM Project Debater and custom AI algorithms to generate and moderate a public conversation during the tournament over questions like \"Is Serena Williams the best player in tennis?\\'\\' and \"Does Pete Sampras have the best all-around tennis game?\"')]\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m\n",

        "In this tutorial, you created a RAG agent using LangChain in python with watsonx. The LLM you worked with was the IBM Granite-3.0-8B-Instruct model. The sample output is important as it shows the significance of this [generative AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/generative-ai) advancement. The AI agent was successfully able to retrieve relevant information via the `get_IBM_US_Open_context` tool, update its memory with each interaction and output appropriate responses. It is also important to note the agent's ability to determine whether tool calling is appropriate for each specific task. When the agent had the information necessary to answer the input query, it did not use any tools for question answering.\n",
